This document is made for anyone who wants to learn
constraint programming using MiniCP as a support.

This tutorial will continuously evolve.
Don't hesitate to give us feedback or suggestions for improvement.
You are also welcome to report any mistake or bug.


What is MiniCP
==============
The success of the MiniSAT solver has largely contributed to the dissemination of (CDCL) SAT solvers.
The MiniSAT solver has a neat and minimalist architecture that is well documented.
We believe the CP community is currently missing such a solver that would permit newcomers to demystify the internals of CP technology. 
We introduce MiniCP, a white-box bottom-up teaching framework for CP implemented in Java. 
MiniCP is voluntarily missing many features that you would find in a commercial or complete open-source solver. 
The implementation, although inspired by state-of-the-art solvers, is not focused on efficiency but rather on readability to convey the concepts as clearly as possible.
MiniCP is small and well tested.


Javadoc

MiniCP source code is available from bitbucket_.

**Using an IDE**

We recommend using IntelliJ_ or Eclipse_.

From IntelliJ_ you can import the project:

.. code-block:: none

    Open > (select pom.xml in the minicp directory and open as new project)


From Eclipse_ you can import the project:

.. code-block:: none

    Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects (select minicp directory)


**From the command line**

Using maven_ command line you can do:


.. code-block:: none

    $mvn compile # compile all the project
    $mvn test    # run all the test suite

Some other useful commands:

.. code-block:: none

    $mvn checkstyle:checktyle   # generates a report in target/site/checkstyle.html
    $mvn findbugs:gui           # opens a gui with potential source of bugs in your code
    $mvn jacoco:report          # creates a cover report in target/site/jacoco/index.html
    $mvn javadoc:javadoc        # creates javadoc in target/site/apidocs/index.html
