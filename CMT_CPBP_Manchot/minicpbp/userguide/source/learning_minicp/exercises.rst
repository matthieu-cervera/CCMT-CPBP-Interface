Unclassified Exercises
**********************

These exercises are from the course given in 2017-2018 @UCLouvain.
They are currently being refreshed, and separated into the various "parts" of the course.

..  Learning Outcomes
    =======================================
    Be able to
    * Understand stateful data structures
    * Understand a domain
    * Implement global constraints
    * Implement custom search
    * Model CP easy problems
    * Use LNS
    * Write unit-tests for constraints and models
    * Debug constraints, models, etc



Compact table algorithm for negative table constraints
==================================================================

Implement `NegTableCT.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/engine/constraints/NegTableCT.java?at=master>`_


Of course you should get a strong inspiration from the
`TableCT.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/engine/constraints/TableCT.java?at=master>`_
implementation you did in a previous exercise.

Check that your implementation passes the tests `NegTableTest.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/test/java/minicp/engine/constraints/NegTableTest.java?at=master>`_
