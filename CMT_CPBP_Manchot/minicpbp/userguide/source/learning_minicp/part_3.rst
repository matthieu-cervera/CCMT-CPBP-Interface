DFS Explicit Stack
===================


The search algorithm of MiniCP is *depth-first-search*.
It is implemented using a recursive method in the class
`DFSearch.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/search/DFSearch.java?at=master>`_.
To avoid `stack-overflow` exceptions due to a too deep recursion in Java
we ask you to reimplement the depth-first search with an explicit stack
instead of relying on the recursion-call stack.

Consider the following search tree where branches to execute are represented as letters:


.. image:: ../_static/dfs.svg
    :scale: 50
    :width: 250
    :alt: DFS
    :align: center


A DFS exploration should execute the above branches in the following sequence `A, D, E, B, C, F, G`.
When backtracking, the previous state must be restored, requiring that the state is saved with the
`save` operation before the branch is executed and restored with the `restore` operation when the branch terminates.
For example; a valid sequence that successfully saves and restores the state when backtracking is:
`save->A->save->D->restore->save->E->restore->restore->save->B->restore->save->C->save->F->restore->save->G->restore->restore`.
Note that the state manager performs a `save` operation prior to searching and a `restore` operation after search
concludes. The `save` operation is executed in pre-order fashion while the `restore` operation is executed in a post-order fashion.
The following code snippet shows a recursive implementation. Note that the saving and restoring of states is performed
in the method `withNewState` of the state manager `sm`:

.. code-block:: java

    private void dfs(SearchStatistics statistics, Predicate<SearchStatistics> limit) {
        if (limit.test(statistics))
            throw new StopSearchException();
        Procedure[] branches = branching.get();
        if (branches.length == 0) {
            statistics.incrSolutions();
            notifySolution();
        } else {
            for (Procedure b : branches) {
                sm.withNewState(() -> { // State is saved before procedure is called.
                    try {
                        statistics.incrNodes();
                        b.call();
                        dfs(statistics, limit);
                    } catch (InconsistencyException e) {
                        statistics.incrFailures();
                        notifyFailure();
                    }
                }); // State is restored when procedure terminates.
            }
        }
    }

Skeleton code for a solution is given below. However, there are many possible implementations, so feel free to not use
the skeleton code.

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3

    private void dfs(SearchStatistics statistics, Predicate<SearchStatistics> limit) {
        Stack<Procedure> alternatives = new Stack<Procedure>();
        expandNode(alternatives, statistics); // root expansion
        while (!alternatives.isEmpty()) {
            if (limit.test(statistics))
                throw new StopSearchException();
            try {
                alternatives.pop().call();
            } catch (InconsistencyException e) {
                notifyFailure();
                statistics.incrFailures();
            }
        }
    }
    private void expandNode(Stack<Procedure> alternatives, SearchStatistics statistics) {
        // TODO
    }


The idea of this solution is wrap the save, restore, and branch executions inside `Alternative` closure objects,
as illustrated on the next figure showing the stack after the root node expansion at line 3.

Check that your implementation passes the tests `DFSearchTest.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/test/java/minicp/search/DFSearchTest.java?at=master>`_.

Remark (optional): It is possible to reduce the number of operations by skipping the save and restore
operations for the for the last branch of any node (the branches B, C, E, and G in the
example above).
The sequence of operations becomes `save->A->save->D->restore->E->restore->save->B->restore->C->save->F->restore->G`.
As stated above, the state manager will perform a save operation before searching and a restore operation once searching
concludes.

Implement a Custom Search
=================================

Modify the Quadratic Assignment model `QAP.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/examples/QAP.java?at=master>`_
to implement a custom search strategy. A skeleton code for a custom search is the following one:


.. code-block:: java

        DFSearch dfs = makeDfs(cp, () -> {
            IntVar sel = selectMin(x,
                    vari -> vari.size() > 1, // filter
                    vari -> vari.size()      // variable selector
            );
            if (sel == null)
                return EMPTY;
            int v = sel.min(); // value selector (TODO)
            return branch(
                () -> cp.post(equal(sel,v)),
                () -> cp.post(notEqual(sel,v))
            );
        });


* As a variable heuristic, select an unbound variable `x[i]` (a facility `i` not yet assigned to a location) that has a maximum weight `w[i][j]` with another facility `j` (where `x[j]` may be bound or not).
* As a value heuristic, on the left branch place this facility on a location :math:`k` which is the closest possible to another location possible for the facility `j` you selected earlier. On the right branch remove the value :math:`k`.
* Hint: `selectMin` is a generic method parameterized by 'T' and 'N' (the type on which the minimum is computed). To implement this heuristic, adding pairs `(i,j)` as a type for `T` is probably the easiest way to go:

.. code-block:: java

    public static <T, N extends Comparable<N>> T selectMin(T[] x, Predicate<T> p, Function<T, N> f)

Sequencer Combinator
======================

Sometimes we wish to branch in a given order on two families of variables, say `x[]` and then `y[]`, as shown in the next picture.
A variable in `y` should not be branched on before all the variables in `x` have been decided.
Furthermore, we may want to apply a specific heuristic on `x` which is different from the heuristic we want to apply on `y`:


.. image:: ../_static/combinator.svg
    :scale: 50
    :width: 200
    :alt: combinator
    :align: center

This can be achieved as follows:

.. code-block:: java

    IntVar [] x;
    IntVar [] y;
    makeDfs(and(firstFail(x),firstFail(y)))


The `and` factory method creates a  `Sequencer.java <https://bitbucket.org/minicp/minicp/src/HEAD/src/main/java/minicp/search/Sequencer.java?at=master>`_.
You must complete its implementation.
